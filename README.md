<h1>Computationional marketing thesis: Using AI to help in product generation into the energy sector</h1><br>
  
This projects develops a complete methodology involving fiels such as computational marketing, statistics, engineering, Artificial       Intelligence and business understanding to help electrical engineers in the process of product generation. 
  
It has been developed with Python, Docker, Nginx and PostgreSQL and its scope is to create an algorithm that using clustering and optimisation techniques creates a custom product for each customer. 

It take in account the customer preferences, and customer type to performs a good classification of customers, and with some data gathering using marketing knowledge and surveys we can recommend the product that fits better the customer.

  The product generationa algorithm is based on the knapsack optimisation algorithm.
